# üìò Java vs C++ ‚Äì Complete Comparative Notes

## üî∞ Introduction

Java and C++ are both high-level, object-oriented programming languages.  
They are used in system development, application software, game development, and more ‚Äî but differ fundamentally in execution model, memory management, and syntax structure.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Java Runtime Architecture: JVM, JDK, JRE

### ‚òï JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- **Full Form**: Java Virtual Machine  
- **Purpose**: Executes Java bytecode (.class files)  
- **Platform**: JVM is platform-dependent (each OS has its own JVM implementation), but Java is platform-independent because it runs on the JVM.  
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Load class files
  - Verify bytecode
  - Execute bytecode
  - Perform garbage collection
- **Key Point**: JVM does **not compile** code, it **runs compiled bytecode**

üìå *JVM = Execution Engine*

---

### ‚òï JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

- **Full Form**: Java Runtime Environment  
- **Purpose**: Provides environment to **run** Java applications  
- **Contains**:
  - JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
  - Java class libraries
  - Other runtime tools
- **Does Not Contain**: Java compiler or tools for developing Java apps

üìå *JRE = JVM + Libraries (for running Java apps only)*

---

### ‚òï JDK (Java Development Kit)

- **Full Form**: Java Development Kit  
- **Purpose**: Full-featured software development kit to **develop and run** Java programs  
- **Contains**:
  - JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
  - Java Compiler (`javac`)
  - Development tools (debuggers, profilers, etc.)
- **Required By**: Developers

üìå *JDK = JRE + Compiler + Dev Tools*

## üßæ 8. When to Use

- **Use Java if**:
  - You want to build cross-platform applications.
  - You are developing Android apps.
  - You need high security and memory management.

- **Use C++ if**:
  - You are building system-level software or game engines.
  - You need performance-critical applications.
  - You want low-level access to hardware or OS.
