# üìò Java vs C++ ‚Äì Complete Comparative Notes

## üî∞ Introduction

Java and C++ are both high-level, object-oriented programming languages.  
They are used in system development, application software, game development, and more ‚Äî but differ fundamentally in execution model, memory management, and syntax structure.

## üßæ 8. When to Use

- **Use Java if**:
  - You want to build cross-platform applications.
  - You are developing Android apps.
  - You need high security and memory management.

- **Use C++ if**:
  - You are building system-level software or game engines.
  - You need performance-critical applications.
  - You want low-level access to hardware or OS.
